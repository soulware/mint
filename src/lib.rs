//! `mint` — macaroon-authenticated scoped-credential vending for Tigris.
//!
//! Prototype tracking `docs/design-mint.md`. The mint verifies a
//! caller-presented macaroon against its macaroon root key, looks up
//! a role, renders the role's IAM-policy template from the macaroon's
//! caveats, mints a scoped short-lived keypair, and returns it. It is
//! never in the data path.
//!
//! This crate lives in the elide workspace during the design phase and
//! is deliberately free of `elide-*` dependencies — it is destined to
//! become a standalone OSS project. The Tigris IAM call is the one
//! production-coupled piece and sits behind [`iam::KeypairMinter`]; the
//! prototype ships [`iam::FakeMinter`] so the whole flow runs without a
//! live account.
