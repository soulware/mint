//! Macaroon issuance (`docs/design-mint.md` § *Credential macaroon &

//!
//! Every macaroon mint here is a fresh chain **from the root** (only
//! the root holder can mint; a client can only attenuate). Three
//! mint points, each stamped with its own positively-required `op`:
//!
//! 1. [`mint_invite`] — `op=enroll`, the reusable non-expiring
//!    participation gate. No principal identity; carries the current
//!    `invite` nonce.
//! 2. [`mint_credential_ticket`] — `op=enroll-exchange`, short-lived,
//!    minted at `POST /v1/enroll` once the presented (client-
//!    attenuated) invite has verified and a pending record exists.
//!    Carries the self-asserted `sub`/`cnf` forward.
//! 3. [`mint_credential`] — `op=assume-role`, non-expiring, minted at
//!    `POST /v1/enroll-exchange` after operator approval. Same
//!    `sub`/`cnf`; no `exp`.
//!
//! MAC verification, the `op`/`aud`/`invite` gates, the holder-of-key
//! PoP and the pending/approval lookup are the HTTP layer's job (they
//! need the root, config and the state store). The functions here are
//! pure given an already-authenticated macaroon.
