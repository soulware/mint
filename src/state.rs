//! Mint enrollment state: the current invite nonce, the transient
//! pending-enrollment table, and the long-lived enrolled-client
//! registry (`docs/design-mint.md` § *Enrollment* / *Mint state in the
//! store bucket*).
//!
//! State lives behind an [`object_store::ObjectStore`]: in production
//! the bucket-backed implementation under the `_mint/` prefix of the
//! store bucket (accessed via a self-vended `mint-rw` keypair, not the
//! admin credential); in dev / tests a `LocalFileSystem` or `InMemory`
//! backend. The same key layout applies either way:
//!
//! ```text
//! _mint/invite                       current random nonce (one object)
//! _mint/clients/pending/<sub>.json   transient (sub, pub, invite, first_seen, peer_ip);
//!                                    GC'd at ticket-exp, deleted at approve()
//! _mint/clients/enrolled/<sub>       long-lived {pub, approved_by, approved_at,
//!                                    fingerprint_shown, kid, rev_epoch, mac}; powers
//!                                    the re-enrollment fast path
//! _mint/clients/revoked/<sub>        revocation tombstone {rev_epoch, revoked_by,
//!                                    revoked_at, kid, mac}; carries the high-water
//!                                    rev_epoch so approve() resumes above it
//! ```
//!
//! **Every enrolled-registry entry carries a MAC over its body keyed by
//! the keyring generation that issued it.** A holder of a `mint-rw`
//! bucket credential can `PutObject` to `_mint/clients/enrolled/<sub>`, so the
//! object body cannot be trusted on its own — only mint instances
//! holding the corresponding [`Keyring`] key can produce a valid MAC.
//! [`Store::get_enrolled`] re-derives and constant-time-compares; a
//! mismatch is treated as if the record were absent (logged loudly
//! server-side; opaque to the client).
//!
//! The macaroon keyring does **not** live in object storage — it is
//! the master mint secret and stays on local disk
//! (`<data_dir>/root_keys/`, mode 0600 per file). For multi-instance
//! deployments operators replicate it out-of-band (e.g. systemd
//! `LoadCredential=`), since instances sharing a `_mint/` prefix must
//! agree on every `(kid, key)` or they mint and approve in a way the
//! sibling cannot verify.
//!
//! Concurrency: `record_pending` uses `PutMode::Create`
//! (`If-None-Match: *`) so multi-instance writes are serialised
//! bucket-side; the conditional primitive is the only ordering
//! mint relies on — no in-process mutex.
