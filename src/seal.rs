//! Template seal — the operator-signed manifest pinning every role's
//! authority surface against tamper between provisioning and render
//! time (`docs/design-mint-template-seal.md`).
//!
//! The seal MACs the substrate that drives `/v1/assume-role`'s policy
//! output: each role's TTL bounds and the BLAKE3 hash of its policy
//! template's content. A bucket-credential
//! holder cannot forge a seal — only a process holding the macaroon
//! keyring can produce a valid MAC, the same trust anchor that signs
//! `_mint/clients/enrolled/<sub>` (PR #454).
//!
//! Authoring is an authenticated call to a running daemon:
//! `POST /v1/admin/seal` ([`crate::admin`]) hashes the daemon's own
//! already-loaded [`Config`] via [`Seal::build_from_config`], MACs it
//! under the keyring, PUTs `seal.json`, and writes the local sealed
//! cache. There is no local staging file.
//!
//! [`resolve_startup`] resolves what the daemon serves: a verified bucket
//! seal yields a [`SealState::Serving`] surface drawn from the local
//! sealed cache (or adopted from `roles_dir/`); a missing or unsatisfiable
//! seal yields [`SealState::Dormant`]. The served policy bytes live in the
//! immutable [`crate::sealed_cache::TemplateSet`] for the process
//! lifetime — the request path never re-reads disk.
